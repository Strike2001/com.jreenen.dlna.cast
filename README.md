# Homey DLNA

Adds support for DLNA certified devices. At the moment this project in in Alpha stage, it is very likely that you have to repair devices multiple times as the version number increases. If you expect a bug free app please don't install this app at alpha stage. At the moment device discovery might take minutes to find all your devices this will be improved at a later stage.

## Donations
If you like the work on this project please consider a donation. Of course, this is optional and you should in no way feel obligated to send a donation.  The donations will be spent on buying a second Homey to use as a development Homey which supports me to keep this app running on older and future firmware versions of Homey.
